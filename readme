Simple Pong Game
This is a simple Pong game created during the course "From idea to app using AI tools" using the ChatGPT AI language model. The game is implemented using the Pygame library, which provides a framework for creating video games in Python.

Overview
The code initializes a game window with an 800x600 resolution and sets up the game's components, such as the player, CPU paddles, and the ball. The game features background music, sound effects for ball hits, and images for the ball and background.

Main Components
PLAYER_WIDTH, PLAYER_HEIGHT, PLAYER_VELOCITY: Player paddle dimensions and velocity
BALL_RADIUS, BALL_VELOCITY_X, BALL_VELOCITY_Y: Ball dimensions and velocity
SCORE_PLAYER, SCORE_CPU: Variables to track player and CPU scores
player, cpu, ball: Rectangular objects representing the player paddle, CPU paddle, and ball
Game Loop
The game loop handles user input, CPU paddle movement, ball movement, collision detection, and display updates. Here are the main features of the game loop:

User input: The player can control their paddle using the "W" and "S" keys to move it up and down.
CPU paddle movement: The CPU paddle moves to follow the ball's Y-coordinate with a randomized speed.
Ball movement: The ball moves in the X and Y directions based on its current velocity.
Collision detection: The code checks if the ball collides with the top/bottom of the screen, paddles, or goes beyond the left/right edges of the screen. Based on the collision, it adjusts the ball's velocity, updates scores, and plays sound effects.
Display updates: The game window is updated with the current state of the game components, including the background image, paddles, ball, and score text.
The game runs at 60 frames per second, providing a smooth gaming experience.

How to Run
To run the game, you'll need to install Python and the Pygame library. Once you have these installed, simply execute the script, and the game will start. To close the game, press the close button on the game window.

Enjoy playing this simple Pong game!
